/*
    Create a Class Car that would have the following fields: carPrice and color and method calculateSalePrice()
    which should be returning a price of the car.
    Create 2 subclasses: Sedan and Truck. The Truck class has a field as weight and has its own implementation of
    calculateSalePrice() method in which returned price is calculated as following: if weight>2000 then returned price
    car should include 10% discount, otherwise 20% discount.
    The Sedan class has field as length and also does its own implementation of calculateSalePrice():
    if length of sedan is >20 feet then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10% discount
